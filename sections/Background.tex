This project builds on the idea of multicast file distribution described in RFC1235\cite{john_ioannidis_coherent_1991}. Clients report which blocks they are missing as a vector of bits, where missing blocks are indicated by a 1 bit. The length of each block is fixed; we will assume that it is 512 bytes for this project.
