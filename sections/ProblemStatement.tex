The project will investigate how to avoid so-called “acknowledgement implosion” when distributing a file using multicast. If all of the nodes that successfully receive a packet were to acknowledge it, then the sender would receive a very large number of \glspl{ACK}, when it fact it is most interested in understanding which node did not receive the packet, hence to which node (or nodes) it should retransmit the packet.
